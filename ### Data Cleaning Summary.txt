### 5 Key Insights from the Data

1. **Concentration of Goals Among a Few Players:**
   - The mean goals scored is 1.7, but the median is 0, and the maximum is 36. This indicates that most players score very few or no goals, while a small number of star players account for most of the scoring.

2. **Defensive vs. Offensive Contribution:**
   - Median assists and goals are both 0, reinforcing that only a select group (mainly attackers and midfielders) produce scoring contributions, while a majority focus on defensive duties.

3. **Card Discipline:**
   - The dataset shows some players received up to 15 yellow cards and 2 red cards in a season. The average yellow cards per player is 3.3, signaling strict officiating or aggressive play styles for select players.

4. **Variation in Involvement:**
   - The average passes per player is 298, but many players (especially subs or backups) have far fewer, showing a steep hierarchy within teams regarding who gets the ball and dictates play.

5. **Penalty Specialists are Rare:**
   - Only a few players take penalties; the mean is 0.19 and the max is 6. Most players don’t score penalties at all, highlighting the reliance on designated specialists.
